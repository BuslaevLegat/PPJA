Thanks for trying out the Fresh Meat 3.0.0-beta-3! Here's some important information you'll need to know:

- If you have Even More Recipes - Meat (EMR-Meat) pack installed you must remove it. These recipes have been moved to Fresh Meat. All future recipes requiring meat will be added to Fresh Meat.
- The CPA portion will be an optional download upon release. Currently all options default to disabled. If you do not want animal looking crops you can remove this portion.
- This beta is not balanced at all. There's a lot of copy + paste values. I welcome all balancing suggestions either on Nexus or Github.
- This beta accounts for an unreleased version of BugNet. If you do not have BugNet installed PFM BugNet and the items used in it will not load. This may become an optional download but I haven't decided.
- To get the most out of this beta you will need:
	- Multi Yield Crops
	- Producer Framework Mod
	- Content Patcher Animations
